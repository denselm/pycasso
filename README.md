System to send AI generated art to an E-Paper display through a Raspberry PI unit

# Acknowledgments

Inspiration for this project based on https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie and the very helpful write-up available at https://debugger.medium.com/how-to-build-a-very-slow-movie-player-in-2020-c5745052e4e4 on setting up epaper to work with a Raspberry Pi unit.

Uses omni-epd so that this can work dynamically with many displays: https://github.com/robweber/omni-epd
